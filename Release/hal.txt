This is the story of star wars:
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away.
"but i didnt mean to!" said luke.
"It doesnt matter, that's coming out of your allowance!" raged ben.
"But uncle ben!!!" whined luke.
Luke went to the store to buy another vaporator.
Meanwhile the rebel plans stored in a USB thumb drive were being uploaded to R2-D2 by princess leia.
"ERROR UPLOADING, NO SPACE" chirped R2-D2.
"What?!" screamed Leia.
Storm trooopers stormed the hallway and shot both R2-D2 and Leia.
Leia fell instantly, never to breathe again, while R2-D2's head spun as sparks flew out in all directions.
15 seconds later, R2-D2 was ruined.  The lead storm trooper said "Inform Lord Vader we have the plans".
"R2-D2 where are you" cried a golden robot, C-3P0, as he rounded the corner.
"Blast him!" said the squadron leader.
Lasers flew in C-3P0's direction decapitating his head from his body.  It writhered and then shut down.
Thousands of light years away on Dagobah, a 900 year old jedi named Yoda felt a disturbance in the force.
He crawled up a tree, and made a noose from a vine, then put it around his neck and jumped off the branch.

The evil galictic empire had won complete control over the entire galaxy.

The End.
